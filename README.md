# NimGame OOP

## using :

- **an abstract class and Inheritance** to implement different variants of the game.

- **Backtracking** to implement a non-defeatable computer player.




## PB statement:
Abdelrahman Mohamed is bored of the simple Nim game we developed in the lecture. He decided to make new variants of it but not sure how. His friend Salaheldeen Salah suggested these two different games with different rules. Help them implement them with a computer player. (If you can, make the code generic and structured into functions or modules using OOP techniques. If possible, make a parent abstract class that defines the required behavior of the game and then its children are different variants of the game.)

•	Variant one. In the simple Nim game we developed, the player who takes the last coin loses and the coins the players took away were simply ignored. In this game, the coins go into a pile for each player. The player whose pile contains an even number of coins after the last one is taken wins the game.

•	Variant two. In the simple Nim game we developed, all the coins where put in one pile. In this variant the money is divided to 3 piles as in picture. Each player takes 1, 2 or 3 coins from any pile he likes. The player that takes the last coin loses.
